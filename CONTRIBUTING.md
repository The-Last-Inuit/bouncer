  2. Ask for improved documentation as an [issue].
  3. Comment on [issues that require feedback].
  4. Contribute code via [pull requests].

[pull requests]: https://github.com/thelastinuit/bouncer/pulls

Any code you contribute must be:

  * **Commented:** Public items _must_ be commented.
  * **Documented:** Exposed items _must_ have rustdoc comments with
    examples, if applicable.
  * **Styled:** Your code should be `rustfmt`'d when possible.
  * **Simple:** Your code should accomplish its task as simply and
     idiomatically as possible.
  * **Tested:** You must add (and pass) convincing tests for any functionality you add.
  * **Focused:** Your code should do what it's supposed to do and nothing more.

All pull requests are code reviewed and tested by the CI. Note that unless you
explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion by you shall be under the MIT License without any additional terms or conditions.
